You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n\nThis is a code generation task. Please help me write the code. The programming language for the code is javascript. In the code, I have already provided a portion of it, and the remaining part needs to be completed by you. The placeholder 'begin to write code' is where you begin to complete the code.\n\nHere are examples of this task:\n\nCode content:\nfunction remove_Occ(s, ch) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {\n        if (s[i] === ch) {\n            s = s.substring(0, i) + s.substring(i + 1);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    //begin to write code\n\nComplete code:\n```javascript\nfunction remove_Occ(s, ch) {\n    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {\n        if (s[i] === ch) {\n            s = s.substring(0, i) + s.substring(i + 1);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        if (s[i] === ch) {\n            s = s.substring(0, i) + s.substring(i + 1);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return s;\n}\n\n\n```\n\n\n\nPlease help complete the following code.\nThe prompt for the code is: Write a function to find the number of subsequences having product smaller than k for the given non negative array.\nThe code content is:\n-----------------------------\nfunction no_of_subsequences(arr, k) {\n    const var_0 = 1;\n    const var_1 = 1;\n    const var_2 = 0;\n    const var_3 = 1;\n    const n = arr.length;\n    const dp = Array.from({ length: k + var_0  }, () => Array(n + var_1 ).fill(var_2 ));\n    for (let i = var_3 ; i <= k; i++) {\n        const var_4 = 1;\n        for (let j = var_4 ; j <= n; j++) {\n            const var_5 = 1;\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - var_5 ];\n            //begin to write code\n-----------------------------\n\nRequirements:\n1. I only need the function and related package import, don't generate any other imformations such as examples usage or test cases.\n2. Follow the specified format strictly below.\n3. Do not change the function name.\n4. The original code content must be fully included in the complete code you generate.\n5. Do not generate \"console.log\" statement, do not use \"require\" to import package.\n\nFormat:\n```javascript\nComplete code (including all the content of the code I provided and the code you generated)\n```\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"]]
