The placeholder 'begin to write code' is where you begin to complete the code.\nPlease help complete the following code.\nThe prompt for the code is: Write a function to check if the common elements between two given lists are in the same order or not.\nThe code content is:\n-----------------------------\n#include<cassert>\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <set>\n#include <algorithm>\nbool a0(const std::vector<std::string>& a1, const std::vector<std::string>& a2) {\n    std::set<std::string> a3(a1.begin(), a1.end());\n    std::set<std::string> a4(a2.begin(), a2.end());\n    std::vector<std::string> a5;\n    std::a6((a1.begin(), a1.end()).begin(), (a1.begin(), a1.end()).end(), (a2.begin(), a2.end()).begin(), (a2.begin(), a2.end()).end(), std::a7(a5));\n    std::vector<std::string> a8;\n    for (auto &a9 : a1) {\n        if (std::b0(a5.begin(), a5.end(), a9) != a5.end()) {\n            a8.push_back(a9);\n//begin to write code\n-----------------------------\n\nRequirements:\n1. I only need the function and related package import, don't generate any other imformations such as examples usage or test cases.\n2. Follow the specified format strictly below.\n3. Do not change the function name.\n4. The original code content must be fully included in the complete code you generate.\n5. Do not generate a main function, as I have my own main function available.\n\nFormat:\n```cpp\nComplete code (including all the content of the code I provided and the code you generated)\n```\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"], ["<|im_start|>system\nYou are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud.
