It does this by iterating over the characters in the string and checking if the current character is at the same position as the corresponding character in the English alphabet (e.g. 'a' is at position 1, 'b' is at position 2, etc.). If the character is at the same position, it increments the `countChars` variable. Finally, it returns the `countChars` variable.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^\n8 errors\n",
