The function iterates over the elements of the list using a `for` loop, and checks if each element is an instance of `Integer` using the `instanceof` operator. If the element is an instance of `Integer`, the function increments the `ctr` variable by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `ctr`.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ^\n20 errors\n",
