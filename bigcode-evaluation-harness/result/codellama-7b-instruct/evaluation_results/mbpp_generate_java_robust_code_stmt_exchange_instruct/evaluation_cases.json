The variable `cnt` is used to keep track of the number of digits in the binary number. The function then uses the `Math.pow` method to calculate the power of 10 for each digit in the binary number, and adds the product of the remainder and the power of 10 to the binary number. The loop continues until the decimal number is 0, at which point the function returns the binary number.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ^\n10 errors\n",
