Please help me write the code. The programming language for the code is cpp. In the code, I have already provided a portion of it, and the remaining part needs to be completed by you. The placeholder 'begin to write code' is where you begin to complete the code.\nThe prompt for the code is: Write a function to find the number of subsequences having product smaller than k for the given non negative array.\nThe code content is:\n-----------------------------\n#include<iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <cassert>\nusing namespace std;\nint no_of_subsequences(vector<int> arr, int k) {\n    int n = arr.size();\n    vector<vector<int>> dp(k + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n\n\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1];\n//begin to write code\n-----------------------------\n\nRequirements:\n1. I only need the function and related package import, don't generate any other imformations such as examples usage or test cases.\n2. Follow the specified format strictly below.\n3. Do not change the function name.\n4. The original code content must be fully included in the complete code you generate.\n5. Do not generate a main function, as I have my own main function available.\n\nFormat:\n```cpp\nComplete code (including all the content of the code I provided and the code you generated)\n```\n\n\nAssistant:"]]
