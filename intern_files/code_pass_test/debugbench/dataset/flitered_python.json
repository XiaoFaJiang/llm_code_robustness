As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    -

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case!

Anyway, here is the proof.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nIn one direction, note that all four operations preserve this property. The starting pair (1, 1) has it since $gcd(1, 1)=1=2^0$, the first two operations preserve the gcd, and the last two operations can multiply the gcd by 2 (or not). Thus, gcd(a, b) can only be a power of 2.\\n\\nConversely, starting from (1, 1) and multiplying the first term repeatedly by 2 we can obtain any pair of the form $(2^n, 1)$, then subtracting $1$ from $2^n$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 1)$.\\n\\nMultiplying the second term by 2 repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 2^m)$, then by subtracting $n$ from $2^m$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod n)$.\\n\\nSuppose we want to obtain the pair (n, k), where k<n and gcd(n, k)=1. Consider the infinite arithmetic progression (n, n+k, n+2k, ...). By Dirichlet\\'s theorem, this progression contains infinitely many primes. Consider one of them: p=n+jk for some $j \\\\geq 0$.\\n\\nBy a slight generalization of [Artin\\'s conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConjecture.html) (the generalization may need proof, but Artin\\'s conjecture was proved by Christopher Hooley, [\"On Artin\\'s Conjecture\"](https://eudml.org/doc/150785), in 1967, assuming the [Generalized Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis)), there are infinitely many such p for which 2 is a primitive root of unity modulo p, meaning that $2^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ and $2^{k} \\\\not \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ for $0<k<p-1$.\\n\\nWe know we can obtain any pair of the form $(p,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod p)$. Since p is prime, the multiplicative group $\\\\mathbb Z_p^*$ is cyclic. Since 2 is a generator (its order is equal to the order of the group), we can obtain any pair (p, k) where $1 \\\\leq k <p$ using powers of 2 modulo p, including the k we want.\\n\\nBut this is the same as (n+jk, k) and then by repeatedly subtracting k from n+jk we can obtain (n, k), as desired.\\n\\nBy symmetry (doing the same thing in reverse if necessary), we can obtain any pair (n, m) where gcd(m, n)=1. Finally, multiplying m and n by (possibly different) arbitrary powers of 2 we can obtain any pair whose gcd is a power of two.\\n\\nEdited: The initial proof was wrong and I corrected it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: Logarithmic: $O(\\\\max(\\\\log a, \\\\log b))$.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $O(1)$.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isReachable(self, targetX: int, targetY: int) -> bool:\\n        def gcd(a, b):\\n            while b:\\n                a, b=b, a%b\\n            return a\\n        d=gcd(targetX, targetY)\\n        while d!=1:\\n            if d&1:\\n                return False\\n            d>>=1\\n        return True\\n        \\n```", "level": "hard", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def isReachable(self, targetX: int, targetY: int) -> bool:\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            redefine b:\n                a, b=b, a%b\n            return a\n        d=gcd(targetX, targetY)\n        while d!=1:\n            if d&1:\n                return False\n            d>>=1\n        return True\n", "explanations": "\nThe bug is the \"redefine\" keyword which is not defined in Python.\n", "source": "python3_illegal keywords.json"}, {"slug": "baseball-game", "description": "You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4. Traverse through the `nums` list again and for each element `num`, find the sum of all elements in `count` list up to the index `num` and append it to the `res` list.\\n5. Return the `res` list as the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` list.

It initializes a variable `j` to keep track of the number of factors found. For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, it checks if `i` is a factor of n by verifying if `n % i == 0`. If `i` is indeed a factor, it increments `j` and updates the variable `num` with the value of `i`.\\n\\n- The loop continues until `j` becomes equal to k or until all integers from 1 to n have been considered. If `j` becomes equal to `k`, it breaks out of the loop. At the end of the loop, if `j` is equal to `k`, it returns the value of `num`; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate that there is no `kth` factor.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n<!--

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self,

It initializes a variable `j` to keep track of the number of factors found. For each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, it checks if `i` is a factor of n by verifying if `n % i == 0`. If `i` is indeed a factor, it increments `j` and updates the variable `num` with the value of `i`.\\n\\n- The loop continues until `j` becomes equal to k or until all integers from 1 to n have been considered. If `j` becomes equal to `k`, it breaks out of the loop. At the end of the loop, if `j` is equal to `k`, it returns the value of `num`; otherwise, it returns `-1` to indicate that there is no `kth` factor.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n)\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\\n        j = 0\\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\\n            if n % i == 0:\\n                num = i\\n                j += 1\\n            if j == k:\\n                break\\n        return num if j == k else -1\\n```", "level": "medium", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:\n        j = 0\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                num = i\n                j += 1\n            if j == k:\n                break\n        return num if j == k+1 else -1\n", "explanations": "\nThe bug is that 'j' should be compared to 'k', not 'k+1', leading to wrong results.\n", "source": "python3_condition error.json"}, {"slug": "check-if-string-is-transformable-with-substring-sort-operations", "description": "Given two strings s and t, transform string s into string t using the following operation any number of times:\n\nChoose a non-empty substring in s and sort it in place so the characters are in ascending order.\n\n\t\nFor example, applying the operation on the underlined substring in \"14234\" results in \"12344\".\n\n\n\nReturn true if it is possible to transform s into t.

As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    - if that value is not in our mapping \\n        - return False \\n\\nLoop over t (effectively getting the unique indices for each value of t) \\n- as you do, convert your character into its designated key (This is here for other mapping versions of the problem) \\n- if we do not have that designated ky in our map \\n    - return false \\n- otherwise, loop over lesser character designations in range to character designation \\n    - if we have the map at lesser character designation and the map at lesser character designation points to a list whose first index of occurrence is less than the first index of occurrence of our current character designation, it must be that they are not in order, and can return False \\n- after completing lesser character loop, remove the most recent occurrence of indexes at character designation by popping left from the map at the character designation \\n- if the map now points to an empty list for character designation, remove character designation from the map entirely.    \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S + T)\\n    -

The function starts by initializing a queue and adding the initial board state and the number of moves (0) to the queue. It also initializes a set to keep track of the board states that have already been seen. The function then enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the function takes the first board state and move count from the queue, and checks if the board state is the desired state. If it is, the function returns the number of moves. If not, the function uses a helper function get_neighbors to find all possible moves (by swapping the empty space with its neighboring tiles) and adds them to the queue. The function also adds the new board states to the set of seen states. If the queue becomes empty, the function returns -1 indicating that the desired board state was not reached.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(mn)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(mn)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def slidingPuzzle(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:\\n        def get_neighbors(board):\\n            neighbors = []\\n            r, c = 0, 0\\n            for i in range(2):\\n                for j in range(3):\\n                    if board[i][j] == 0:\\n                        r, c = i, j\\n            for i, j in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\\n                new_r, new_c = r + i, c + j\\n                if 0 <= new_r < 2 and 0 <= new_c < 3:\\n                    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\\n                    new_board[r][c] = new_board[new_r][new_c]\\n                    new_board[new_r][new_c] = 0\\n                    neighbors.append(new_board)\\n            return neighbors\\n\\n        queue = deque()\\n        queue.append((board, 0))\\n        seen = set()\\n        seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in board))\\n\\n        while queue:\\n            board, moves = queue.popleft()\\n            if board == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]:\\n                return moves\\n            for neighbor in get_neighbors(board):\\n                if tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor) not in seen:\\n                    queue.append((neighbor, moves + 1))\\n                    seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor))\\n        return -1\\n```", "level": "hard", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def slidingPuzzle(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        def get_neighbors(board):\n            neighbors = []\n            r, c = 0, 0\n            for i in range(2):\n                for j in range(3):\n                    if board[i][j] == 0:\n                        r, c = i, j\n            for i, j in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                new_r, new_c = r + i, c + j\n                if 0 <= new_r < 2 and 0 <= new_c < 3:\n                    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n                    new_board[r][c] = new_board[new_r][new_c]\n                    new_board[new_r][new_c] = 0\n                    neighbors.append(new_board)\n            return neighbors\n\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append((board, 0))\n        seen = set()\n        seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in board))\n\n        while queue:\n            board, moves = queue.popleft()\n            if board == [[1, 2, 3], [5, 4, 0]]:      \n                return moves\n            for neighbor in get_neighbors(board):\n                if tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor) not in seen:\n                    queue.append((neighbor, moves + 1))\n                    seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor))\n        return -1\n", "explanations": "\nThe board state to check for the solution is incorrect.

Anyway, here is the proof.\\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nIn one direction, note that all four operations preserve this property. The starting pair (1, 1) has it since $gcd(1, 1)=1=2^0$, the first two operations preserve the gcd, and the last two operations can multiply the gcd by 2 (or not). Thus, gcd(a, b) can only be a power of 2.\\n\\nConversely, starting from (1, 1) and multiplying the first term repeatedly by 2 we can obtain any pair of the form $(2^n, 1)$, then subtracting $1$ from $2^n$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 1)$.\\n\\nMultiplying the second term by 2 repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n, 2^m)$, then by subtracting $n$ from $2^m$ repeatedly we can obtain any pair of the form $(n,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod n)$.\\n\\nSuppose we want to obtain the pair (n, k), where k<n and gcd(n, k)=1. Consider the infinite arithmetic progression (n, n+k, n+2k, ...). By Dirichlet\\'s theorem, this progression contains infinitely many primes. Consider one of them: p=n+jk for some $j \\\\geq 0$.\\n\\nBy a slight generalization of [Artin\\'s conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArtinsConjecture.html) (the generalization may need proof, but Artin\\'s conjecture was proved by Christopher Hooley, [\"On Artin\\'s Conjecture\"](https://eudml.org/doc/150785), in 1967, assuming the [Generalized Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis)), there are infinitely many such p for which 2 is a primitive root of unity modulo p, meaning that $2^{p-1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ and $2^{k} \\\\not \\\\equiv 1 \\\\mod p$ for $0<k<p-1$.\\n\\nWe know we can obtain any pair of the form $(p,\\\\ 2^m \\\\mod p)$. Since p is prime, the multiplicative group $\\\\mathbb Z_p^*$ is cyclic. Since 2 is a generator (its order is equal to the order of the group), we can obtain any pair (p, k) where $1 \\\\leq k <p$ using powers of 2 modulo p, including the k we want.\\n\\nBut this is the same as (n+jk, k) and then by repeatedly subtracting k from n+jk we can obtain (n, k), as desired.\\n\\nBy symmetry (doing the same thing in reverse if necessary), we can obtain any pair (n, m) where gcd(m, n)=1. Finally, multiplying m and n by (possibly different) arbitrary powers of 2 we can obtain any pair whose gcd is a power of two.\\n\\nEdited: The initial proof was wrong and I corrected it.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: Logarithmic: $O(\\\\max(\\\\log a, \\\\log b))$.\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $O(1)$.\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def isReachable(self, targetX: int, targetY: int) -> bool:\\n        def gcd(a, b):\\n            while b:\\n                a, b=b, a%b\\n            return a\\n        d=gcd(targetX, targetY)\\n        while d!=1:\\n            if d&1:\\n                return False\\n            d>>=1\\n        return True\\n        \\n```", "level": "hard", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def isReachable(self, targetX: int, targetY: int) -> bool:\n        def gcd(a, b):\n            while b:\n                a, b=b, a%b\n            return a\n        d=gcd(targetX, targetY)\n        while d!=0:\n            if d&1:\n                return False\n            d>>=1\n        return True\n", "explanations": "\nThe loop never ends if gcd of targetX and targetY don't reduce to 1. \n", "source": "python3_condition error.json"}, {"slug": "average-value-of-even-numbers-that-are-divisible-by-three", "description": "Given an integer array nums of positive integers, return the average value of all even integers that are divisible by 3.\nNote that the average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided by n and rounded down to the nearest integer.", "examples": ["Input: nums = [1,3,6,10,12,15]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: 6 and 12 are even numbers that are divisible by 3.

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n\\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\\n            pre[course].append(p)\\n        \\n        taken = set()\\n\\n        def dfs(course):\\n            if not pre[course]:\\n                return True\\n            \\n            if course in taken:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            taken.add(course)\\n\\n            for p in pre[course]:\\n                if not dfs(p): return False\\n            \\n            pre[course] = []\\n            return True\\n        \\n        for course in range(numCourses):\\n            if not dfs(course):\\n                return False\\n\\n        return True\\n```", "level": "medium", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\n\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\n            pre[course].append(p)\n        \n        taken = set()\n\n        def dfs(course):\n            if not pre[course]:\n                return True\n            \n            if course in taken:\n                return False\n            \n            taken.add(course)\n\n            for p in pre[course]:\n                if not dfs(p): return False\n            \n            taken.remove(course)\n            return True\n        \n        for course in range(numCourses):\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n\n        return True\n", "explanations": "\nThe course is removed from 'taken' after dfs, causing incorrect cycle detection in graph.\n", "source": "python3_variable error.json"}, {"slug": "minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid", "description": "Given an m x n grid.

To simplfying the implementation, we divide into two cases: diameter is even or odd. For the case of even diameter, we  count the subtrees by enumerating each vertex as the center. For the case of odd diameter, we enumerate each edge as the center. \\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFor each node $v$ as the center, we root the tree at $v$ and do a DFS. When visiting a vertex $u$, we recursively compute the number of subtrees rooted at $u$ and with depth $i$, for each possible $i$.\\nWhen combining the results from the children of $u$, a naive implementation takes $O(deg(u)\\\\times n^2)$ time. By using prefix sum, it can be reduced to $O(deg(u)\\\\times n)$ time. Thus a DFS takes $O(n^2)$ since the total degree of a tree is $O(n)$.\\nAt root $v$, we combine the results from its children. Since we care about only even diameter and centered at $v$, two branches of same depth $i$ form a subtree of diamter $2i$. When combining the branches one by one, we need to count the way that a current subtree is merged with a small incoming subtree which does not change its diameter.\\nThe case of odd diameter is similar and simpler since there are only two branches for each center edge.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n$O(n^3)$ since each center vertex takes $O(n^2)$.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nLinear.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    # odd/even diameter couned individually\\n    def countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\\n        adj = [[] for i in range(n)]\\n        for u,v in edges:\\n            adj[u-1].append(v-1)\\n            adj[v-1].append(u-1)\\n        def comb(p,q): # merge p and q, res[max(i,j)]+=p[i]*q[j]\\n            if len(q)<len(p): p,q = q,p\\n            res = [0]*len(q)\\n            res[0] = p[0]*q[0]\\n            for i in range(1,len(p)): p[i] += p[i-1]\\n            for i in range(1,len(q)): q[i] += q[i-1]\\n            for i in range(1,len(p)):\\n                res[i] = p[i]*q[i]-p[i-1]*q[i-1]\\n            for i in range(len(p),len(q)):\\n                res[i] = (q[i]-q[i-1])*p[-1]\\n            return res\\n            \\n        def dfs(r,p): # num of subtree rooted at r with given depth\\n            d = [1]\\n            for v in adj[r]:\\n                if v==p: continue\\n                t = [1]+dfs(v,r)\\n                d = comb(t,d)\\n            return d\\n        #end dfs\\n        ans = [0]*n\\n        # odd diameter with (u,v) as center edge\\n        for u,v in edges:\\n            u -= 1;

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

To solve this, we can use a counting sort technique. We will first count the occurrences of each number in the `nums` list and then use the count information to find the number of elements smaller than each element.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4. Traverse through the `nums` list again and for each element `num`, find the sum of all elements in `count` list up to the index `num` and append it to the `res` list.\\n5.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case!

Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4.

Return the `res` list as the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` list. We traverse the list twice, but both traversals are linear in terms of the input size.\\n- Space complexity: O(1) since the `count` list is of constant size (101) and the `res` list is the same size as the input `nums` list.

To simplfying the implementation, we divide into two cases: diameter is even or odd. For the case of even diameter, we  count the subtrees by enumerating each vertex as the center. For the case of odd diameter, we enumerate each edge as the center. \\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nFor each node $v$ as the center, we root the tree at $v$ and do a DFS. When visiting a vertex $u$, we recursively compute the number of subtrees rooted at $u$ and with depth $i$, for each possible $i$.\\nWhen combining the results from the children of $u$, a naive implementation takes $O(deg(u)\\\\times n^2)$ time. By using prefix sum, it can be reduced to $O(deg(u)\\\\times n)$ time. Thus a DFS takes $O(n^2)$ since the total degree of a tree is $O(n)$.\\nAt root $v$, we combine the results from its children. Since we care about only even diameter and centered at $v$, two branches of same depth $i$ form a subtree of diamter $2i$.

The function starts by initializing a queue and adding the initial board state and the number of moves (0) to the queue. It also initializes a set to keep track of the board states that have already been seen. The function then enters a while loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, the function takes the first board state and move count from the queue, and checks if the board state is the desired state. If it is, the function returns the number of moves. If not, the function uses a helper function get_neighbors to find all possible moves (by swapping the empty space with its neighboring tiles) and adds them to the queue. The function also adds the new board states to the set of seen states. If the queue becomes empty, the function returns -1 indicating that the desired board state was not reached.\\n\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: $$O(mn)$$\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n- Space complexity: $$O(mn)$$\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def slidingPuzzle(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:\\n        def get_neighbors(board):\\n            neighbors = []\\n            r, c = 0, 0\\n            for i in range(2):\\n                for j in range(3):\\n                    if board[i][j] == 0:\\n                        r, c = i, j\\n            for i, j in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\\n                new_r, new_c = r + i, c + j\\n                if 0 <= new_r < 2 and 0 <= new_c < 3:\\n                    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\\n                    new_board[r][c] = new_board[new_r][new_c]\\n                    new_board[new_r][new_c] = 0\\n                    neighbors.append(new_board)\\n            return neighbors\\n\\n        queue = deque()\\n        queue.append((board, 0))\\n        seen = set()\\n        seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in board))\\n\\n        while queue:\\n            board, moves = queue.popleft()\\n            if board == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]:\\n                return moves\\n            for neighbor in get_neighbors(board):\\n                if tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor) not in seen:\\n                    queue.append((neighbor, moves + 1))\\n                    seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor))\\n        return -1\\n```", "level": "hard", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def slidingPuzzle(self, board: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        def get_neighbors(board):\n            neighbors = []\n            r, c = 0, 0\n            for i in range(2):\n                for j in range(3):\n                    if board[i][j] == 0:\n                        r, c = i, j\n            for i, j in [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]:\n                new_r, new_c = r + i, c + j\n                if 0 <= new_r < 2 and 0 <= new_c < 3:\n                    new_board = List[List[int]]\n                    new_board[r][c] = new_board[new_r][new_c]\n                    new_board[new_r][new_c] = 0\n                    neighbors.append(new_board)\n            return neighbors\n\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append((board, 0))\n        seen = set()\n        seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in board))\n\n        while queue:\n            board, moves = queue.popleft()\n            if board == [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]:\n                return moves\n            for neighbor in get_neighbors(board):\n                if tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor) not in seen:\n                    queue.append((neighbor, moves + 1))\n                    seen.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in neighbor))\n        return -1\n", "explanations": "\nThe new_board variable is instantiated as an undefined list of lists.\n", "source": "python3_undefined objects.json"}, {"slug": "reachable-nodes-with-restrictions", "description": "There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.\nYou are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Initialize two pointers, p1 and p2, for the two input arrays nums1 and nums2, respectively, both starting at index 0.\\n2. Create an empty list new to store the merged array.\\n3. Iterate through both arrays using the pointers. Compare the elements pointed to by p1 and p2. Append the smaller element to the new array and increment the corresponding pointer.\\n4. After the iteration, there might be remaining elements in one of the arrays. Iterate through the remaining elements and append them to the new array.\\n5. Calculate the median based on the length of the new array. If the length is even, take the average of the middle two elements. If the length is odd, take the middle element.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity:\\n<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two input arrays.\\n\\n- Space complexity:\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nO(m + n), as the merged array new can contain all the elements from the two input arrays.\\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:\\n        p1 = 0\\n        p2 = 0\\n        new = []\\n        while p1 < len(nums1) and p2 < len(nums2):\\n            if nums1[p1] < nums2[p2]:\\n                new.append(nums1[p1])\\n                p1 += 1\\n            else:\\n                new.append(nums2[p2])\\n                p2 += 1\\n        while p1 < len(nums1):\\n            new.append(nums1[p1])\\n            p1 += 1\\n        while p2 < len(nums2):\\n            new.append(nums2[p2])\\n            p2+= 1\\n        if len(new) % 2 == 0:\\n            index = len(new) // 2\\n            median = (new[index] + new[index-1]) / 2\\n        else:\\n            median = float(new[len(new)//2])\\n        return median\\n```", "level": "hard", "type": ["indentation error", "variable value error", "colon missing", "indexing error"], "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float\n        p1 = 0\n        p2 = 0\n        new = []\n        while p1 < len(nums1) and p2 < len(nums2):\n            if nums1[p1] < nums2[p2]:\n            new.append(nums1[p1])\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            new.append(nums2[p2])\n            p2 += 1\n        while p1 < len(nums1):\n            new.append(nums1[p1])\n            p2 += 1\n        while p2 <= len(nums2):\n            new.append(nums2[p2])\n            p1 += 1\n\n        if len(new) % 2 == 0:\n            index = len(new) // 2\n            median = (new[index] + new[index-1]) / 2\n        else:\n            median = float(new[len(new)//2])\n        return median\n", "source": "python3_quadruple.json"}, {"slug": "can-place-flowers", "description": "You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not.

To solve this, we can use a counting sort technique. We will first count the occurrences of each number in the `nums` list and then use the count information to find the number of elements smaller than each element.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4. Traverse through the `nums` list again and for each element `num`, find the sum of all elements in `count` list up to the index `num` and append it to the `res` list.\\n5. Return the `res` list as the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` list. We traverse the list twice, but both traversals are linear in terms of the input size.\\n- Space complexity: O(1) since the `count` list is of constant size (101) and the `res` list is the same size as the input `nums` list.

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n\\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\\n            pre[course].append(p)\\n        \\n        taken = set()\\n\\n        def dfs(course):\\n            if not pre[course]:\\n                return True\\n            \\n            if course in taken:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            taken.add(course)\\n\\n            for p in pre[course]:\\n                if not dfs(p): return False\\n            \\n            pre[course] = []\\n            return True\\n        \\n        for course in range(numCourses):\\n            if not dfs(course):\\n                return False\\n\\n        return True\\n```", "level": "medium", "type": ["colon missing", "wrong comment mark"], "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]] '\n\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\n        for course, p in prerequisites\n            pre[course].append(p)\n        \n        taken = set()\n\n        def dfs(course):\n            if not pre[course]:\n                return True       \n            if course in taken:\n                return False       \n            taken.add(course)\n            for p in pre[course]:\n                if not dfs(p): return False        \n            pre[course] = []\n            return True\n        \n        for course in range(numCourses):\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n        return True\n", "source": "python3_double.json"}, {"slug": "minimum-obstacle-removal-to-reach-corner", "description": "You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n.

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n\\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\\n            pre[course].append(p)\\n        \\n        taken = set()\\n\\n        def dfs(course):\\n            if not pre[course]:\\n                return True\\n            \\n            if course in taken:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            taken.add(course)\\n\\n            for p in pre[course]:\\n                if not dfs(p): return False\\n            \\n            pre[course] = []\\n            return True\\n        \\n        for course in range(numCourses):\\n            if not dfs(course):\\n                return False\\n\\n        return True\\n```", "level": "medium", "type": ["variable value error", "colon missing"], "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\n        for course, p in prerequisites\n            pre[course].append(p)\n        \n        taken = set()\n\n        def dfs(course):\n            if not pre[course]:\n                return True       \n            if course in taken:\n                return False       \n            taken.add(course)\n            for p in pre[course]:\n                if not dfs(p): return False        \n            taken.remove(course)\n            return True\n        \n        for course in range(numCourses):\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n        return True\n", "source": "python3_double.json"}, {"slug": "check-if-two-string-arrays-are-equivalent", "description": "Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.\nA string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.", "examples": ["Input: word1 = [\"ab\", \"c\"], word2 = [\"a\", \"bc\"]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nword1 represents string \"ab\" + \"c\" -> \"abc\"\nword2 represents string \"a\" + \"bc\" -> \"abc\"\nThe strings are the same, so return true.", "Input: word1 = [\"a\", \"cb\"], word2 = [\"ab\", \"c\"]\nOutput: false", "Input: word1  = [\"abc\", \"d\", \"defg\"], word2 = [\"abcddefg\"]\nOutput: true"], "constraints": "1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 103\n1 <= word1[i].length, word2[i].length <= 103\n1 <= sum(word1[i].length), sum(word2[i].length) <= 103\nword1[i] and word2[i] consist of lowercase letters.", "oracle_code": "class Solution:\n    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:\n        word3=\"\".join(word1)\n        word4=\"\".join(word2)\n        if word3==word4:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False", "content": "**1**.First we will join the contents or concatenate the Strings present in the list using join()\\n**2**.then compare 2 list.\\n**3** if true return true else return false\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:\\n        word3=\"\".join(word1)\\n        word4=\"\".join(word2)\\n        if word3==word4:\\n            return True\\n        else:\\n            return False\\n```\\n**code**\\nOnline Solution :\\n    -Thank you for this solution @jeevabharathiS\\n        \\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) \\n        return((\"\".join(word1))==(\"\".join(word2)))\\n```", "level": "easy", "type": ["parentheses mismatch", "== and = confusion"], "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def arrayStringsAreEqual(self, word1: List[str], word2: List[str]) -> bool:\n        word3=\"\".join(word1)\n        word4=\"\".join(word2\n        if word3=word4:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n", "source": "python3_double.json"}, {"slug": "valid-permutations-for-di-sequence", "description": "You are given a string s of length n where s[i] is either:\n\n'D' means decreasing, or\n'I' means increasing.\n\nA permutation perm of n + 1 integers of all the integers in the range [0, n] is called a valid permutation if for all valid i:\n\nIf s[i] == 'D', then perm[i] > perm[i + 1], and\nIf s[i] == 'I', then perm[i] < perm[i + 1].\n\nReturn the number of valid permutations perm.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

To solve this, we can use a counting sort technique.

Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4.

Return the `res` list as the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` list. We traverse the list twice, but both traversals are linear in terms of the input size.\\n- Space complexity: O(1) since the `count` list is of constant size (101) and the `res` list is the same size as the input `nums` list.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you!

To solve this, we can use a counting sort technique. We will first count the occurrences of each number in the `nums` list and then use the count information to find the number of elements smaller than each element.\\n\\n# Approach\\n1. Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4. Traverse through the `nums` list again and for each element `num`, find the sum of all elements in `count` list up to the index `num` and append it to the `res` list.\\n5.

As such, we can consider this one with not too much of a stretch of the mind. \\n\\nEach integer value in our selected string has a list of indices at which it appears. IF we make a mapping of these list of indices for each value in order of appearance in s, we can use that against the ordering of appearance of list of values in t (we do not necessarily need to make said list of t, but could if we so chose) \\n\\nOnce we have this map, our first bet is to actually get the set of unique items in t, which can be done rather nicely with generators that will do the autoskip inclusions as needed. \\n\\nUsing unique t, our first check is that all of the unique t values are present. If not, then we can skip to returning False. \\n\\nOtherwise, we need to loop over t, and for each character check if it is in our map. If not, also False. \\n\\nIf we then loop over values up to this point (such that if we drew say 5 we\\'d go from 0 to 4 inclusive) we need to find that the value is in indexes and that the indexes at that point has a starting value at least as advanced or more so than the indexes for the drawn values first appearance. If this does not occur, then they are not in ascending order and may also return False. \\n\\nIf all of that passes, we need to discard the current item at the front of indexes at the drawn character. If in doing so we now eliminate that list, we need to eliminate the character drawn from indices entirely (this is why we have that second check for inclusion near the top). \\n\\nIf we manage all of that, there\\'s nothing to stop the transformation and can return True. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nUse collections default dict with collections deque for each character valuation in s \\n\\nMake a map of the character values -> list of indices of occurrence in order from first to last \\n\\nMake a set of unique t values \\n\\n- For each unique t value in unique t values \\n    - if that value is not in our mapping \\n        - return False \\n\\nLoop over t (effectively getting the unique indices for each value of t) \\n- as you do, convert your character into its designated key (This is here for other mapping versions of the problem) \\n- if we do not have that designated ky in our map \\n    - return false \\n- otherwise, loop over lesser character designations in range to character designation \\n    - if we have the map at lesser character designation and the map at lesser character designation points to a list whose first index of occurrence is less than the first index of occurrence of our current character designation, it must be that they are not in order, and can return False \\n- after completing lesser character loop, remove the most recent occurrence of indexes at character designation by popping left from the map at the character designation \\n- if the map now points to an empty list for character designation, remove character designation from the map entirely.    \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S + T)\\n    - O(S) to build s mapping \\n    - O(T) to build t unique characters \\n    - O(T) to loop over characters in T \\n        - within which we do at most O(5) work to loop in range of lesser characters on average \\n    - Total then is O(S + T + ~5T) -> O(S + C * T) -> O(S + T)  \\n\\n\\n- Space complexity : O(S + t) \\n    - Store O(s) lists of size to account for S, so O(S) \\n    - Store O(t) \\n    - Remove storage for potentially all of O(S) \\n    -

I have more than 200 Leetcode videos.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@KeetCodeExAmazon\\n\\n---\\n\\n# Approach\\n\\n1. Create a class named `Solution` (assuming it is part of a larger program).\\n2. Define a method within the `Solution` class called `canFinish` that takes in two parameters: `numCourses` (an integer representing the total number of courses) and `prerequisites` (a list of lists representing the prerequisites for each course).\\n3. Create an empty dictionary called `pre` using the `defaultdict` class from the `collections` module. This dictionary will store the prerequisites for each course.\\n4. Iterate over each pair `(course, p)` in the `prerequisites` list:\\n   a. Append `p` to the list of prerequisites for the course `course` in the `pre` dictionary.\\n5. Create an empty set called `taken`. This set will keep track of the courses that have been visited during the depth-first search (DFS) traversal.\\n6. Define an inner function called `dfs` that takes in a parameter `course`. This function will perform the DFS traversal to check if the course can be finished.\\n7. If the list of prerequisites for the current `course` is empty (i.e., there are no remaining prerequisites), return `True` since the course can be finished.\\n8. If the `course` is already present in the `taken` set, return `False` since there is a cycle in the course dependencies.\\n9. Add the `course` to the `taken` set to mark it as visited.\\n10. Iterate over each prerequisite `p` for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary:\\n    a. If the DFS traversal returns `False` for any prerequisite `p`, return `False` since the course cannot be finished.\\n11. Set the list of prerequisites for the current `course` in the `pre` dictionary to an empty list, indicating that all the prerequisites have been satisfied.\\n12. Return `True` at the end of the `dfs` function since all the prerequisites for the `course` have been satisfied.\\n13. Iterate over each `course` in the range from 0 to `numCourses` (exclusive) using a `for` loop.\\n14. If the DFS traversal of the current `course` returns `False`, it means the course cannot be finished, so return `False` from the `canFinish` method.\\n15. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means all the courses can be finished, so return `True` from the `canFinish` method.\\n\\nIn summary, the algorithm performs a depth-first search to check if it is possible to finish all the courses given their prerequisites. It uses a dictionary to store the prerequisites for each course and a set to keep track of the visited courses during the traversal. If there is a cycle in the course dependencies or if any course cannot be finished, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.\\n\\n# Python\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\\n\\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\\n\\n        for course, p in prerequisites:\\n            pre[course].append(p)\\n        \\n        taken = set()\\n\\n        def dfs(course):\\n            if not pre[course]:\\n                return True\\n            \\n            if course in taken:\\n                return False\\n            \\n            taken.add(course)\\n\\n            for p in pre[course]:\\n                if not dfs(p): return False\\n            \\n            pre[course] = []\\n            return True\\n        \\n        for course in range(numCourses):\\n            if not dfs(course):\\n                return False\\n\\n        return True\\n```", "level": "medium", "buggy_code": "\nclass Solution:\n    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n\n        pre = defaultdict(list)\n        for course, p in prerequisites\n            pre[course].append(p)\n        \n        taken = set()\n\n        def dfs(course):\n            if not pre[course]:\n                return True       \n            if course in taken:\n                return False       \n            taken.add(course)\n            for p in pre[course]:\n                if not dfs(p): return False        \n            pre[course] = []\n            return True\n        \n        for course in range(numCourses):\n            if not dfs(course):\n                return False\n        return True\n", "explanations": "\nA colon is missing after the 'for' loop in line 5 which will generate SyntaxError.\n", "source": "python3_missing colons.json"}, {"slug": "neighboring-bitwise-xor", "description": "A 0-indexed array derived with length n is derived by computing the bitwise XOR\u00a0(\u2295) of adjacent values in a binary array original of length n.\nSpecifically, for each index i in the range [0, n - 1]:\n\nIf i = n - 1, then derived[i] = original[i] \u2295 original[0].\nOtherwise, derived[i] = original[i] \u2295 original[i + 1].\n\nGiven an array derived, your task is to determine whether there exists a valid binary array original that could have formed derived.\nReturn true if such an array exists or false otherwise.\n\nA binary array is an array containing only 0's and 1's", "examples": ["Input: derived = [1,1,0]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: A valid original array that gives derived is [0,1,0].\nderived[0] = original[0] \u2295 original[1] = 0 \u2295 1 = 1 \nderived[1] = original[1] \u2295 original[2] = 1 \u2295 0 = 1\nderived[2] = original[2] \u2295 original[0] = 0 \u2295 0 = 0", "Input: derived = [1,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: A valid original array that gives derived is [0,1].\nderived[0] = original[0] \u2295 original[1] = 1\nderived[1] = original[1] \u2295 original[0] = 1", "Input: derived = [1,0]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There is no valid original array that gives derived."], "constraints": "n == derived.length\n1 <= n\u00a0<= 105\nThe values in derived\u00a0are either 0's or 1's", "release_time": 1684130489, "oracle_code": "class Solution:\n    def doesValidArrayExist(self, derived: List[int]) -> bool:\n        b = True\n        for n in derived:\n            b = not b if n else b\n        return b", "content": "# Intuition\\n<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->\\nWe can start with an arbitary original[0] and iteratively calculate original[n - 1] from the formula derived[i] = original[i] \\u2295 original[i + 1].\\nThe only thing we need to check is if derived[n - 1] = original[n - 1] \\u2295 original[0].

Create a `count` list of size 101 (since the constraint specifies that the numbers in the input list will be in the range [0, 100]).\\n2. Traverse through the `nums` list and count the occurrences of each number by incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` list.\\n3. Create a new list `res` to store the results.\\n4. Traverse through the `nums` list again and for each element `num`, find the sum of all elements in `count` list up to the index `num` and append it to the `res` list.\\n5. Return the `res` list as the final result.\\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the `nums` list. We traverse the list twice, but both traversals are linear in terms of the input size.\\n- Space complexity: O(1) since the `count` list is of constant size (101) and the `res` list is the same size as the input `nums` list.

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you!

This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?

This is because we are trying to achieve the pairing of minimum number of moves and maximum number of moves. As such, we are trying to sort the move value space and scan over it linearly. This can be achieved with a few key insights from the problem that keep it at a medium level. \\n\\nFirst, we have a list size lower bound of 3. This is actually dreadfully important for one of our key edge cases that make this easily solvable so don\\'t discard such things when they come up! \\n\\nSecond, we have that all the stone values are unique. \\n\\nThird, we have that all the stone values are positive integers from 1 to 10^9. This is important both as an insight into the fact that we are working with only positive values, and that we are working with a very large value space compared to a much relatively smaller value ordination (there are 10^9 values for the stones, but only 10^4 positions at most for them) \\n\\nWe are also provided with a helpful hint \\n>For the minimum, how many cows are already in place? For the maximum, we have to lose either the gap A[1] - A[0] or A[N-1] - A[N-2] (where N = A.length), but every other space can be occupied ?  \\n\\nWe turn first to the idea of the maximum, where we have a gap we will need to lose of either between the first and second position or ultimate and penultimate position. \\n\\nIf we consider a list of 3 items, our minimum, what is our minimum values to get our minimal return? Not to spoil anything, but it is 1, 2, 3 \\n\\nThis is key to the problem, since there are no spaces provided between the values, so our return should be [0, 0] \\n\\nBy realizing the impact of this the approach follows below. Try to work out for a few values and sizes to get the feel for it and you\\'ll likely find an understanding either intuitively or by action. I recommend working with small list sizes and trying to generate [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 2] with only 3 or so items. It\\'ll be difficult, but worth it for the understanding pay off. \\n\\n# Approach\\n<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->\\nThe original ordering of the stones is not valid compared to their ordinal positioning, and since we know we have a size limit much less than a value limit, we start by sorting. \\n\\nThen, we want to know how much space we have to work witin, so get the size of your listing (how many stones do you have regardless of how much they are worth?) \\n\\nThen, we need to calculate the two largest costs, move penultimate and move ultimate (final in the code) \\n\\nMove penultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the second to last spot and the first spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have (Since you moved over the whole thing!) plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nMove ultimate is the cost of swapping the stones at the last spot and second spot, minus the cost of the number of stones you have plus 2 to deal with the fact that they are unique\\n\\nIf either of these is 0, the other must be locked in as most moves, as most moves will be the max of these two options (try to convince yourself of why that is the case! This relates to the idea of the list sizings, and is really clearly seen with a list of size 3)\\n\\nIf either is 0, \\n- min legal moves is min of 2 and most moves \\n- return min legal moves and most moves \\n\\nOtherwise we now must consider how many max legal moves are there really? \\n\\nSet max legal moves to 0 \\nSet starting index to 0 \\nenumerate index and stone in stones \\n- while stones at starting index lte stone - stone length \\n    - increment starting index \\n- our max legal moves here is the max of itself (so it preserves good discoveries) and index - starting index + 1 (+1 for the fact we use 0 indexing) \\n- but, it cannot get too big! Remember, we already found the actual max, so don\\'t let anything in here fool you! Set max legal moves as such to min(max(max_legal_moves, index - starting_index + 1), max_moves) \\n- this keeps our newly found max legal less than our actual max moves \\n\\nWhen done enumerating return length - max legal moves, max moves \\n\\n# Complexity\\n- Time complexity : O(S log S + S)\\n    - O(S log S) to sort the stones \\n    - O(S) to loop over (while loop is incindental, as it can only run as many times as the length of stones as well in total, so it does not add to this)  \\n\\n- Space complexity : O(1)\\n<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->\\nNo additional space utilized \\n\\n# Code\\n```\\nclass Solution:\\n    \\'\\'\\'\\n        Test cases walk through \\n        Given 7, 4, 9 prove 1, 2                                                            6, 5, 4, 3, 10, prove 2, 3 \\n\\n        Sort stones -> 4, 7, 9                                                              3, 4, 5, 6, 10 \\n        Stone length -> 3                                                                   5\\n        Move penultimate = 7 - 4 - 3 + 2 = 2                                                6-3-5+2 = 0 \\n        Move final = 9 - 7 - 3 + 2 = 1                                                      10-4-5+2 = 3 \\n        Neither is 0, so we cannot return for sure                                          Move penultimate is 0, so move final is assured \\n                                                                                            This means we can return [min(2, 3), 3] -> [2, 3]\\n\\n        Max legal moves is 0                                                                For completeness, max legal moves is 0, max moves is 3  \\n        starting index is 0                                                                 starting index is 0 \\n\\n        Enumeration                                                                         Enumeration\\n            index is 0, stone is 4                                                             index is 0, stone is 3 \\n            stones[0] lte 4 - 3 ?
